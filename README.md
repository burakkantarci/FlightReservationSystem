Flight Reservation System 
=========================

This is a project of CS201, Fundamental Structures of Computer Science, using C++

In this homework assignment, we are asked to implement an flight reservation system by using linked
lists. In this system, there is a list of flights, and for each flight, there will be a list of passengers. 

The flight entries stored in a sorted (in ascending order of flight ids) linear singly linked list with no
dummy head node. For each flight, the passenger entries also stored in a linear singly linked list
with no dummy head node.

Project allows you to examine pass by value & pass by reference and memory management quite easily.
Main goal is to see what happens while inserting, deleting and modifying node values as 2D array.

Thanks
